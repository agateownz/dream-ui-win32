# dream-ui-win32
A simple win32 UI wrapper.

# History of this Project
This was a simple test of C++11 along with my coding capabilities.
It turns out the result was quite good for the time spent (1-2 weeks).
This code is a few years old already. I wrote it in late 2015.
The motivation for this library was that writing Win32 GUI code was really bad and the wrappers available at the time weren't in C++11.
So I decided to give it a try, and here it is.

# Does It Have Bugs?
Yes, many, many bugs. I didn't knew about unit tests at the time, so...
